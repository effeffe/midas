MidasConfig
---------
Defines Midas include dirs and libraries

Use this module by invoking find_package with the form::

  find_package(Midas
    [REQUIRED]             # Fail with error if Midas is not found
    )                     

This module finds headers and requested component libraries. During installation,
paths to these directories are hard-coded and results are reported in variables::

  MIDAS_FOUND            - True if headers and requested libraries were found
  MIDAS_PACKAGE_NAME     - Midas package name
  MIDAS_INCLUDE_DIRS     - Midas include directories
  MIDAS_LIBRARY_DIRS     - Link directories for Boost libraries
  MIDAS_LIBRARIES        - Midas component libraries to be linked
